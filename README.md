This is a training project for the course CS50 named as project0
it consists of 4 html pages
#1 the index.html is a brief history of my education and professional experience, in this page I used bootstrap component, image, table, ordered and unorderded list, flex, grid and sass properties
#2 the work_exp_desc.html is designed mainly by taking the advantage of flex and briefly shows the type of projects I used to work on
#3 the honors.html is designed mainly by taking the advantage of grid system of bootstrap and represents the awards and honors I achieved
#4 the membership.html is designed mainly to be a practice of creating a form for membership

all the pages use the bootstrap stylesheet and also a css file that is tried to cover up all the required parts of this project
other files include variables.scss/css inheritence.scss/css nesting.scss/css which are all used to satisfy the application of sass in this project
